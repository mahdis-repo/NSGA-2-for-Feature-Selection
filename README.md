# Multiple Objective Optimization Using NSGA-2 Algorithm

There are three methods of feature selection: Filter methods, Wrapper methods and Embedded methods.
This is a wrapper method in which selected features are being evaluated by a KNN (neighbors = 5). 

## NSGA-2 and binary desicion variables

We either select the feature (1) or we dont (1):

after getting the embeddings we have 80 features and here is the initial population:

Objectives:

- error : 1 - accuracy
- number of features

  and we want to minimize both of our objective, after generating 100 populations of size 100:

  and that's pretty cool! we can classify embeddings with an accuracy of 97% using only 5 features!


### Installing

You may have Keras, Tensorflow and Scikit-Learn but you may need to install Pymoo. A multi-Objective Optimzation Library.
